Ideas for potential Schemas
    a. Self-Contained


ImageId:
  brushes:
      brushid:
          meta: name, timestamp, ...
          draw_function: 'javascriptfunction'
      ...
  palettes:
      paletteid:
          meta: name, timestamp, ...
          opacity: ...
          colors: ...
      ...
  paths:
      pathid:
          meta: id, timestamp, ...
          palette: palleteid
          brush: brushid
          coordinates: (_ts, x, y), ...

This allows for all images to be self-contained and easy to visualize as a
single entity however it obviously takes a shit on any modularity you might
want and we probably also want to store files as separate files, ie:
    imagerepos/examplerepo/[brushes.json, palettes.json, paths.json, image.json]

if this is the case we would probably be better served using something akin to 

Images:
    imageid:
        meta: ...
        commithistory: timestamp: id, ...
        paths: pathid: ?, ...
        layers: ... ?   \
        brushes: ... ?  - These might not be necessary
        palettes: ... ? /
        contributors: ?
        (essentially at some point this just becomes a shortcut 
                to avoid pulling from repo constantly)
    ...
Paths:
    pathid:
        meta: ..., [palette,brush?]
        palette: ...
        brush: ...
        coordinates: (_ts, x, y), ...
Palettes:
    pathid
